#three components, whitespace separated: repeat time command
# -repeat starts with @, and is optional, with optional day-of-the-week-list:
#  e.g.: '', '@', '@mo-fr', '@su,we'
# -time is not optional, and can be relative, e.g.: '1hr25m', '30'
#  or absolute. e.g.: '10:30am', '16:02:04'
# -command is optional, can be any arbitrary command.
#   there is a default which is alarm-ish

#relative times are converted to fixed times at runtime
#e.g.: at 3:46:02 pm
#30                       => 16:16:02
#30m                      => 16:16:02
#30s                      => 15:46:32
#1h30m120s firefox        => 17:18 firefox
#1h pidgin                => 14:46 pidgin

#absolute times
#10:32:02am               => default alarm at 10:32:02 am
#10:00                    => default alarm at 10:00 am
#22:04                    => firefox at 10:04 am
#6:2:7                    => default alarm 06:02:07 am
