i use Ubuntu, 11.04 at the time of writing
i abhor forever: flashy useless guis (e.g.: unity, GNOME Shell)
i like forever: typically kb-centric, modular, clever guis (e.g.: xmonad)

at the time of writing:
display server = X
window manager = xmonad
status bar = dzen2
file manager = nautilus
editor = vim
network = Network Manager (for gnome, i.e.: nm-applet)
music = rhythmbox
